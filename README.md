# vFlux-Stats-Kit
PowerCLI scripts to gather VMware performance stats and write them to InfluxDB.

## Introduction
Welcome to the vFlux Stats kit!  Use these scripts to gather VMware Sphere performance stats and write them to the InfluxDB time series database.  Then, display your metrics in all their glory through the Grafana web interface.

## Requirements
You'll need at least one Windows box with VMware PowerCLI installed.  This should be a dependable device as you will likely run this as a scheduled task.

As for InfluxDB and Grafana, they can be installed on Windows if desired.  If you want to run them on CentOS 7, check out my write up at:

I will be adding more supporting materials soon (blogs, videos, etc.). If you need help, hit me up on twitter.
